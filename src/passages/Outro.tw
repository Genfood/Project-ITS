        (font:'Courier New')[Good job, $name! You collected all the files we needed to resume normal operations.
        You connected to the old server and used Diffieâ€“Hellman for exchanging a shared secret,
        you also decrypted the old USB stick, which held valuable informations for out company.
        You also found this old disc in the messy office of your predecessor and learned about RSA.
        Without you, all these data would have been lost.


        You absolutely deserve a raise!]
