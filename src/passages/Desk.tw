:: desk {"position":"400,200"}
## Wow, that desk is messy

You scan the desk and the longer you look the more garbage you find on it:
- a coffee mug with a "cool" slogan: "If you call me nerd, I will call you an ambulance"
- handwritten notes, which look confusing
- a 10:1 figure of Gollum, which is kinda creepy
- broken pencils

You decide to collect the notes, as you hope that they might be useful in the future.
