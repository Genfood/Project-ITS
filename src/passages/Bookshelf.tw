## You are standing in front of the bookshelf

The bookshelf is this boring IKEA thing everbody has in their apartment. ItÂ´s filled with a bunch of books and magazines.
A few of them jump into your eye:

- Playboy issue #7 of 1986
- Diffie-Hellmann for Dummies
- RSA: have fun
- A magazine for rifles
- How to hash important stuff like passwords
- A Nature Lifestlye magazin called "Fish and Flesh"
